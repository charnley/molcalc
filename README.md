# MolCalc - Molecule Calculator

Hosted at http://dgu.ki.ku.dk/molcalc

MolCalc is a web interface that allows anyone to build 
small molecules  and estimate molecular properties such as molecular structure, 
heats of formation and other thermodynamic properties, 
vibrational frequencies and vibrational modes, 
and molecular orbitals and orbital energies in a 
matter of seconds or minutes - depending on the size.
