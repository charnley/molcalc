#2 INSERT A NEW CALCULATION TYPE
  
  You need to create several files.
  For example, for a new calculation 'CALX',
  you need to generate:

  # GAMESS Input Header
  gamess/templates/clax.inp

  # GAMESS result viewer
  gamess/process/clax.php

  Which will be used by 
  methods/calculation.php and 
  gamess/treatment.php

  Then add the calculation to 
  the array in methods/calculation.php

  And thats it.
