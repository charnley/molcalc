*What is MolCalc?
MolCalc is a web interface that allows anyone to build 
small molecules  and estimate molecular properties such as molecular structure, heats of formation, vibrational frequencies and vibrational modes, and molecular orbitals and orbital energies in a matter of seconds or minutes - depending on the size.

MolCalc is designed for teaching as opposed to research - specifically for assignments in which students build their own molecules and estimate their own molecular properties. MolCalc is designed to run fast and therefore estimated molecular properties will not match experimental values exactly, and in some cases be quite different. The idea is to have students develop a “chemical intuition” about how molecular structure affects molecular properties, without performing the underlying calculations by hand (which would be near impossible for all but the simplest chemical systems).

*How can I use MolCalc in teaching?
Just like a pocket calculator or a symbolic math program (such as Mathematica or MAPLE), MolCalc allows one to assign “higher level” chemical problems, that are not practically possible to solve previously.

For example, one might now ask students to compute the effect of a substituent on a particular vibration, and then rationalize it using molecular orbitals. Or one might ask more open ended questions such as “build a molecule with an unusually long C-C single bond”.

*How does MolCalc work?
In the Molecule Editor page the molecular structure is build using Jmol and energy minimized using the UFF force field as implemented in Jmol.

In the Molecule Calculator page the structure is re-optimized at the PM3 level of theory for a maximum of 50 steps. This structure is then used to compute the heat of formation or vibrational frequencies at the PM3 level of theory, or the molecular orbitals using the RHF/STO-3G level of theory. These calculations are performed with the GAMESS program. OpenBabel is used to manage input files and coordinate files.

*Can I modify and/or install MolCalc on my own server?
Yes, MolCalc is distributed through github under the GPL license (https://github.com/charnley/molcalc). You must obtain a copy of the GAMESS code separately from http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/download.html

The interface code uses PHP5, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 and is very modular. It therefore quite easy to add new capabilities to MolCalc.

*Who is involved with MolCalc?
MolCalc 1.0 is written by Jimmy Charnley Kromann based on an idea by Jan Jensen. Toke Fritzemeier wrote an early prototype. The development of MolCalc is supported by the University of Copenhagen through the Education at its Best initiative (Den gode uddannelse).


FAQ
#1 - Insert New Page
#2 - Insert New Calculation Type
#3 - Add Jmol funcionalities to the Editor


#1 INSERT NEW PAGE

  Put a page 'pagename.php' in methods/
  it will then be loaded via siteroot/pagename

  Then add the page to the menu if needed.
  Menu is located in includes/header.inc.php


#2 INSERT A NEW CALCULATION TYPE
  
  You need to create several files.
  For example, for a new calculation 'CALX',
  you need to generate:

  # GAMESS Input Header
  gamess/templates/clax.inp

  # GAMESS result viewer
  gamess/process/clax.php

  Which will be used by 
  methods/calculation.php and 
  gamess/treatment.php

  Then add the calculation to 
  the array in methods/calculation.php

  And thats it.


#3 JMOL INTERACTION
  
  Jmol is integrated in jquery .click()'s 
  if you want to expand functionalities with 
  jmol, just create a new button and use jmolScript(CMD)
  to issue a command. Commands from version 12 can 
  be found in:

  http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/

  Good luck!
